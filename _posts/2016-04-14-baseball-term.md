---- baseball term ----

--- Batting
 G = games played
 AB = At-bats
 H = Hits
 BB = Bases on balls (Walks)
 IBB = Intentional bases on balls
 HP = Hit by pitch
 R = Runs scored
 RBI = Runs batted in
 1B = singles
 2B = Doubles
 3B = Triples
 HR = Home runs
 BA = Batting Average = H / AB
 OBA = On-base acerage = (H +BB + HP) / (AB + BB + HP)
 TB = Total bases = 1(1B) + 2(2B) + 3(3B) + 4(HR)
 SLG = Slugging average = TB / AB
 OPS = On-base plus slugging = OBA + SLG
 ISO = Isolated power = SLG - BA = (TB - H) / AB
 TPQ = Total power quotient = (HR + RBI + TB) / AB
 PwrF = Power factor = SLG / BA = TB / H
 SF = Sacrifice flies
 SH = Sacrifice hits (Bunts)

---- Base Running

 SB = stolen bases
 CS = caught stealing
 OOB = Out on base

---- Piching

 W = Wins
 L = Losses
 PCT = Winning percentage = W / (W + L)
 ER = Earned Runs allowed
 IP = Innings pitched
 ERA = Earned run average = (9 * ER) / IP
 SV = Saves
 K = Strikeout
 BB = Bases in balls (allowed)

---- Fielding

 A = Assists
 E = Errors
 PO = putouts
 FLD = Fielding average = (A + PO) / (A + PO + E)
 RF = Range factor (per game) = (A + PO) / G


--- A batter's on-base percentage = OBP

 HBP = Hit by pitch

 OBP <- (H + BB + HBP) / (AB + BB + HBP + SF)

--- stolrn base percentage = SB%

 SB% <- SB / (SB + Cs)

 POP Award

 POP = BA + OBA + SLG

--- HEQ
-- HEQ-Offense

 HEQ-O = TB + R + R + RBI + SB + (0.5*BB)

 HEQ is not recommended as a measure to compare players from diffrent seasons

--HEQ-Defense
 PO = Putouts
 A = Assists
 E = Error
 DP = Double Plays
 HEQ-D are statistics in weighted
 PMF = Position Multiplication Factor # adjust the numbers in such a way that a season of 400 is considered outstanding

-- Position HEQ-D
 C = (PO + 3*A + 2*DP * 2*E) * (0.445) [0.445 is PMF, and PO are cappes at 800]
 1B = (0.25*PO + 3A + DP - 2*E) * (0.51) [0.51 is PMF]
 2B,3B,SS = (PO + A + DP - 2*E) * (PMF) [PMF2B = 0.46, PMFSS = 0.548, PMF3B = 0.888]
 OF = (PO + 4*A + 4*DP - 2E) * (1) [i.e., no PMF for OF]

--- Player Career Total

PCT = HEQ-O + HEQ-D
